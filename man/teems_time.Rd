\usage{
teems_time(
  time_steps,
  CPHI = 0.1,
  KAPPA = 0.05,
  LRORG = 0.05,
  INIDELTA = FALSE,
  interval_switch = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_steps}{Integer vector of variable length (default is \code{NULL}).
\code{"time_steps"} are inputted as the desired chronological years of steps
including initial reference year.}

\item{CPHI}{Numeric of length 1 or path to a csv with value (Value) by region
(REGr) and timestep (ALLTIMEt) (default is \code{0.1}). The investment
adjustment coefficient shows the ratio of investment (at a $1 cost basis)
necessary to gain the equivalent increase in capital stock. For example,
the default value .1 would indicate that for every $1.10 in investment,
capital stock increases by $1. It represents the installment cost in
investment process. The adjustment cost function is typically a convex
function. The investment adjustment rate reflects how quickly the level of
investment adjusts in response to economic changes or new information.}

\item{KAPPA}{Numeric of length 1 or path to a csv with value (Value) by
region (REGr) and timestep (ALLTIMEt) (default is \code{0.05}). The depreciation
rate is the rate at which a physical capital loses its value over time due
to wear and tear, obsolescence, or usage. It is a critical measure in
accounting and economics, as it determines the reduction in value of fixed
assets like machinery, equipment, and buildings. A higher depreciation rate
indicates a faster decline in an asset's productive value.}

\item{LRORG}{Numeric of length 1 or path to a csv with value (Value) by
timestep (ALLTIMEt) (default is \code{0.05}). The global interest rate or rate
of return refers to the average rate at which investments yield returns
across the global economy. This rate is influenced by various factors,
including international demand for capital, central bank policies,
inflation rates, and global economic conditions.}

\item{INIDELTA}{Logical of length 1 (default is \code{FALSE}). INIDELTA determines
the intertemporal initial condition switching mechanism. When FALSE, VKB
will be read from data and the value of ps("capital",r,t) will be
calculated by definition. The slack variables (coefficients) LCAPHAT(r,t)
and LMUHAT(r,t) will be kept at their current level so the motion equations
will be adjusted to zero at the baseline. The value of LCAPHAT(r,t) and
LMUHAT(r,t) can be adjusted to 1 in order to adjust the baseline scenario
to a non-steady state. When TRUE, VKB and the value of ps("capital",r,t)
will be adjusted so the current base year data will become steady state of
the economy. The role of this binary switch can be clearly seen by
examining the post-model VKB header with \code{teems_parse(type = "basedata")}.}

\item{interval_switch}{Logical length 1 (default is \code{FALSE}). Switch
controlling interpretation of \code{"time_steps"} input. When \code{TRUE}, each
element of \code{"time_steps"} is interpreted as an interval between 2 time
steps.}

\description{
\code{teems_time()} loads time related data for non-static model
runs. This includes parameters specific to dynamic runs as well as the
number of timesteps and inferred intrastep intervals. The output of this
function is a required value for the \code{\link[=teems_deploy]{teems_deploy()}} \code{"time_config"}
argument when temporal dynamics are not static (i.e., dynamic).

\details{
\code{teems_time()} return values have no purpose used in isolation and
are rather combined with user inputs in other \code{teems} package functions
within \code{\link[=teems_deploy]{teems_deploy()}} to produce a path-dependent pipeline resulting in
solver-ready input files for \code{\link[=teems_solve]{teems_solve()}}.
