\usage{
ems_option_set(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical of length 1 (default is \code{TRUE}). If
\code{FALSE}, function-specific diagnostics are silenced.}

\item{ndigits}{Integer (default is \code{6}). Exact number of
digits to the right of the decimal point to be written to
file for numeric type double (GEMPack equivalent "real").
This value is passed to the \code{format()} nsmall argument and
\code{round()} digits argument.}

\item{check_shock_status}{Logical of length 1 (default is
\code{TRUE}). If \code{FALSE}, no check on shock element
endogenous/exogenous status is conducted.}

\item{post_set_check}{Logical of length 1 (default is \code{TRUE}).
If \code{FALSE}, no post model check is conducted between the
sets as written out from the Tablo file and solver set
binaries. If a Tablo file with no set writeout is used
(e.g., custom file in in-situ solve mode), this option must
be set to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{timestep_header}{A character vector length 1 (default is
\code{"YEAR"}). Coefficient containing a numeric vector of
timestep intervals. For novel intertemporal models - modify
with caution.}

\item{n_timestep_header}{A character vector length 1 (default
is \code{"NTSP"}). Coefficient containing a numeric vector length
one with sum of timestep intervals. For novel intertemporal
models - modify with caution.}

\item{full_exclude}{A character vector (default is \code{c("DREL", "DVER", "XXCR", "XXCD", "XXCP", "SLUG", "EFLG")}). Specifies
headers to fully exclude from all aspects of the model run.
Failure to designate these headers properly will result in
errors because some headers cannot be aggregated or mapped.
Modify with caution.}

\item{docker_tag}{Character length 1 (default \code{"latest"}).
Docker tag to specify the which Docker image is use.}

\item{margin_sectors}{placeholder}

\item{accuracy_threshold}{Numeric length 1 (default 0.8),
converted to a percentage. 4 digit precision will be
compared against this threshold, generating a warning if it
is not met.}

\item{expand_ETRE}{Logical of length 1 (default is \code{TRUE}). If
\code{FALSE}, no expansion to the ETRE (ETRAE) data header are
carried out. When \code{TRUE}, if ETRE header data does not
contain the full endowment set, missing tuples will be added
with value -1e-05. The sluggish endowment set will be
replace with the general endowment set. ETRE header elements
are not consistent across databases regarding inclusion of
non-sluggish endowments, leading to issues with the ETRAE
coefficient which is read-in with the full set of
endowments.}
