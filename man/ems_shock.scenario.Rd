\title{Specify scenario shock}
\usage{
\method{ems_shock}{scenario}(var, input, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{Character of length 1, the variable to be shocked.}

\item{input}{character length 1, path to a csv file; a data
frame or data frame extension (e.g., tibble, data table).
Must contain a column "Year" corresponding to selected time
steps and "Value" as last column representing an actual
value that will be converted into a percentage-change shock
based on set and time step selection.}

\item{...}{Future extension.}
}
\description{
\code{ems_shock.custom()} loads scenario shocks for
processing as well as conducts a series of compatibility
checks. A scenario shock is one which allows for granular
control over heterogenous shocks that are allocated on a
tuple-specific basis, inputted as a CSV file or dataframe
(or dataframe equivalent) through \code{"input"} in the form of
absolute values. This is in contrast with \code{"custom"} shocks
where the inputs are denominated in percentage change
values.  The accepted set values within \code{"input"} depend on
the \code{"var"} specified and set mappings associated with this
variable but must encompass all tuples prior to any
aggregation (specific to the database being used). Values
will be aggregated according to the selected set
aggregations and converted to percentage change form.
