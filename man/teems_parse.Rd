\title{Parse model results}
\usage{
teems_parse(cmf_path, type = c("variable", "coefficient", "basedata"))
}
\arguments{
\item{cmf_path}{Character length 1 (default is \code{NULL}), path to the
cmf file generated by \code{\link[=teems_deploy]{teems_deploy()}} or created via an
"in-situ" run with \code{\link[=teems_solve]{teems_solve()}}.}

\item{type}{Character length 1, type of data to parse (default includes all).
Choices:
\itemize{
\item \code{"variable"}: Percentage change values for model variables
\item \code{"coefficient"}: Absolute values for model coefficients
\item \code{"basedata"}: Merged pre- and post-model base data values
}}
}
\value{
A list containing the parsed model results according to the specified
type.
}
\description{
\code{teems_parse()} retrieves and processes results from a solved
model run. Results are parsed according to the specified type (variables,
coefficients, or base data). Data validation and consistency checks are
performed during the parsing process.
