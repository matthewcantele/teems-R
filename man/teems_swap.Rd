\title{Load swaps}
\usage{
teems_swap(var, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{var}{Character of length 1, model variable to swap.}

\item{...}{One or more key-value pairs separated by commas. These correspond
to element-specific swaps in the format SETi = "element" or SETi =
c("element1", "element2") where i denotes the variable-specific index (see
examples). Sets not specified are implicitly determined as uniform.}
}
\value{
A list with swap specifications.
}
\description{
\code{teems_swap()} is a helper function that loads swaps, allowing
for a change of endogenous/exogenous variable status. If a swap is
specified using this function, the output is a required input to the
\code{"swap_in"} or \code{"swap_out"} arguments of the \code{\link[=teems_model]{teems_model()}} function.
}
\details{
\code{teems_swap()} return values have no purpose used in isolation. The
standard model-specific closure will be used if no swaps are specified.
Note that full variable swaps can be directly inputted as a character
string in \code{\link[=teems_model]{teems_model()}}.
}
\examples{
# Full variable swaps
tfd_out <- teems_swap(var = "tfd")
qfd_in <- teems_swap(var = "qfd")

# Partial variable swaps (note distinction between "REGr" and "REGs")
chn_food_tfd_out <- teems_swap(var = "tfd",
                               TRAD_COMMi = "food",
                               REGr = "chn")
                               
chn_food_qfd_in <- teems_swap(var = "qfd",
                              TRAD_COMMi = "food",
                              REGs = "chn")

# Partial variable multiple element swaps
